                    <p>
                        My name is Tonian (pronunciation: TOH-nEE-ANN), a Ph.D. candidate at the University of South Florida, where I study sinkhole and other anthropogenic-related deformations using Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperature (PSInSAR). My current project focuses on analyzing satellite images collected in West-Central Florida to improve the detection of sinkhole deformation signals.
                        <br>I enjoy data processing, especially using my GIS and remote sensing-related skills. For my career, I plan to apply these skills to real-world problems related to agriculture, natural disasters, energy, urban development, etc.             
                    </p>
